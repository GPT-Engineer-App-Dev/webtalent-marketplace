# webtalent-marketplace

Please create a landing page for a marketplace called "Particles" that connects businesses with top software talent specializing in web technologies like React, Node, .NET, Go, and JavaScript. 

The landing page should have the following sections:
1. A hero section with a catchy headline explaining the marketplace's purpose and a call-to-action button
2. A section highlighting the benefits for businesses (access to vetted talent, faster hiring, expertise in key technologies)
3. A section highlighting the benefits for developers (exciting projects, competitive rates, career growth)
4. Testimonials from satisfied clients and developers
5. A final CTA to view available developers or sign up

Use a modern, tech-inspired design with engaging visuals. The branding should convey professionalism and expertise.
